v0.2.0 - 2021-07-05

- The sections of the project were broken down into separate classes.
- Each class contains a form for the user to input data.
- Another change from the last feature is that now the user is able to select more than just a date and time.
The users now can also upload their profile information and their preferences for the doggy dates.
- Another functionality that was added on this feature was that users can now interact with other users.
We did that through a comments class. This class is linked to the DatePreferences class, so the users can comment on the
preferences added by other users.
- Another significant change to the project is that now we are using Back4App to create a database. This is significantly different
from the previous feature, in which we simulated a back end using data from a JSON file.
